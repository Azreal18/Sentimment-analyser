<h1 align="center" id="title">Sentiment analyser</h1>

<p id="description">This project represents a fundamental component of my extensive exploration into sentiment analysis. In this specific module users input a text sentence and the system provides sentiment analysis results. As part of a broader learning journey I have undertaken an in-depth study of sentiment analysis techniques and methodologies. This project serves as a practical application of this knowledge allowing me to assess the sentiment of textual input and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This endeavor forms only a fraction of my comprehensive investigation into the field of sentiment analysis. By continually expanding my expertise in this domain I aim to contribute to the development and refinement of sentiment analysis models and techniques ultimately enhancing their utility in various applications.</p>
